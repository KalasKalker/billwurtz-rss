"connaisseur" is from french, meaning expert/judge/taster. "aficionado" is from spanish, it means a fan/enthusiast of something but it also means 'amateur'. The meanings of those 2 words may have merged together a little when used in english, but looking into french and spanish i can see that perhaps the connaisseur may perhaps be a little more high brow than the aficionado</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.14.26</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>3:07 am any tips on how to reconcile with something you have to live with forever? it might be possible to use it to your advantage. ultimately that is the best way to handle these things, if at all possible</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.14.26</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>3:24 am what does your average bass fx chain look like? any tips or warnings for people envious of your mixing? it probably will help a lot to clear the bass frequencies away from the non-bass instruments during times when the full band is playing. single out the instruments that are really doing the low frequency job (bass, kick) and let them have the low end, and keep that mostly out of the other instruments. this can help a lot. and also compressing the bass (not have a lot of loud-soft range) will help usually help. for some reason, wide loud-soft range is usually not too useful on the bass</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.14.26  6:29 am</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>have you ever thought of making a full length album? yes but i'd rather just make many many many songs</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.14.26  6:57 am</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>What is your favourite jazz chord hot take there is no such thing as a 'jazz chord' and also a different chord is favored at each moment of the music</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>What are you thoughts on banjo?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>i've used it in probably the majority of my songs. it's incredibly groovy. so in this case i apologize, if you have ever listened to my music, for all the banjo in it</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>I know it has its use cases and wouldn't want to tell anyone what to play bc who the heck am</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.14.26</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>7:25 am I've always felt banjo is a bit of a subpar instrument. I mean, it produces a unique kind of sound so this fact alone justifies its existence, but to me it always lacked some richness and sexiness that comes from other stringed instruments like guitar. (Side note I just realized - banjo is kinda like a reverse bass. Or maybe ukulele is)</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.14.26</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>8:10 am how many digits of euler's number do you memorize i dont know any of it. havent looked into it yet. i would have but i've been busy making music etc for a long time</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.14.26</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>8:13 am favorite philosopher? surprise me</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>another way to look at it (and also not the only way), for example, is: in the past, most animals have had to brutally f</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.14.26</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>8:19 am have you heard of the new instinct-vs-intellect explanation of the human condition and do you think it's probable? basically that our ape ancestors were completely instinctively orientated to love, but that when they developed a conscious mind it clashed with the instincts, causing it to become psychologically upset which is the mad state we still suffer from today and have for eons tried to free ourselves from i think that's a bit of storytelling and it's certainly not the only way to look at it.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.14.26</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>10:15 am what do i say at the interview to make them want to hire me one classic trick is to ask them questions</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.14.26</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1:14 pm can I count on you to live as long as possible. yes i believe so. i'm very serious about my work, which is intimately connected to being alive</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.14.26</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1:24 pm sorry if this is a rude question but i suspect you'll answer when the time is right: will people be seeing, hearing and feeling new videos from you soon? yes i believe so</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.14.26  1:25 pm</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>What's your favorite Pokémon? the.... yellow one</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.14.26</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1:57 pm Is the sun 5 nanometers away? from what, nevermind, no i dont think so</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.14.26</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>2:37 pm what is the best substitute for curtains .... shades?</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.14.26</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>2:49 pm How do you feel about the word cabbage phonetically?

See, someone I knew recently died of something that almost killed me, and I've been having a horrendous time dealing with all of the things my brain is doing about it. I was feeling exceptionally not OK, went on YT to watch some cat videos to try to calm down, and saw one of your videos in my recommendations. I decided out of curiosity to see which of your videos were released around the time I was sick. And I found out that you posted "if the world doesn't end" right when I was... not quite well yet, but through the dark and experiencing the miracle that I had survived. It helped end a panic attack (so did the cats.) It's so strangely comforting. So I just wanted to thank you. Please keep being weird and amazing. I suppose I need a question here, so... what do you want to do if the world doesn't end? make a huge pile of songs that is twice as high and twice as important as all the others before</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.15.26</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>5:24 pm hey I forgot what my last question was what was it? was it this</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.15.26</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>5:42 pm Do you have any interesting tales from the creation of the music and/or video of outside? had the chorus/title idea first</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.15.26</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>8:02 pm the person who said banjo is subpar... what? they've certainly not heard it in the genre, and it can sound quite sad and wistful and profound in the right song. now my question for you: is there an instrument you feel you've underutilised or not used at all but would want to include more? jeans, for sure</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.15.26</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>8:09 pm what is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything? a book quote.... which sometimes even overshadows the book it's from</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>ask a question</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>ue</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>q stions</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>questions</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:09:14 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

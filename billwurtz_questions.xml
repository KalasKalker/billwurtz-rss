Am I going insane here!?

A:
yes, but, insanity is a tremendous advantage in the arts. You think a lot. you talk a lot, and you write a lot, because you think a lot. (and ultimately this is because you feel a lot). This could be, in some ways, a disadvantage because you're able to talk yourself out of just about anything. But on the other hand it's an endless creative resource that you can use</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>how do you combat lack of motivation</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.2.25

Q: when you were struggling to write songs in the early 2010's, was it only because of perfectionism or did you not have your songwriting procedures solidified at the time.

A:
for the most part after 2009 there was no more struggle. that is generally when the flood gates opened. plenty of things continued to improve and take shape after, but in general from 2009 forward it was significantly more fruitful excitement than struggle. there was also a time, many years before that, where i did plenty of writing instrumentally, but then eventually there was a sort of dark period in between where i had to figure out what i'm saying linguistically and with ideas on the more verbal side of things. but by 2009 or 10 i was fully 'out of the closet', in terms of like, ok, enough moping around not knowing what to do, ready and desperate to just fling open the door and see whatever the fuck comes out</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>why do you just make the current progress of your new videos so enigmatic. just tell me exactly where it's at. right now.</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.2.25

A:
normally i don't have any suggestions or critiques, but there is one thing here that seems like it's begging to be addressed. 5 times you've said 'ueqstion' which is really not right. this is the 'questions' page. what youve done is took the title design and tried to somehow write it in plain text but it doesnt work that way. it's either 'questions' or ue q stions . the q is meant to go first, but that's not so apparent when there is no color scheme to guide you</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Is it ok for gen Z to ask questions here</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.3.25

Q: Is it ok for gen Z to ask questions here

A:
it doesnt matter how old you are, but i would disagree with the logic of grouping the age groups around what i consider arbitrary boundary lines. i think we all can relate to the uncomfortable experience of having a friend who was born 1 day before you, but they are in a different generation because they are on the last day of the previous generation and you are on the first day of the next. i mean how would they even relate to each other, it would be a forbidden friendship</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>where did all the serifs in your videos go</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.3.25

Q: I keep starting to learn a language, but then I get interested in another language and want to learn it instead. How can I (or should I) stick to just one?

A:
sometimes what you really wanna do is alternate between pursuing new languages, then coming back to your strongest one. i think if you let yourself go wild for a little while jumping to new languages, i think quite soon you will get the urge to go back to your strongest one so you can feel better about yourself. and then eventually get restless again and want to do something new again. there might be no reason to deny this natural flow</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>why are people such idiots?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.3.25

And you can always use your desire for future selections as a magnetic motivator toward finishing the current selection. Now you just gotta decide on your selection method. and it really doesnt matter what it is, so you might as well make it something you can be proud of</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Do you prefer the word thingamabob or thingamajig</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.5.25

A:
the trick here is to gravitate towards projects you know mean the most to you. i don't think it's possible to change how much something means to you, but it is possible to seek out things that mean the most to you. and those projects will be the ones that will last. Then, suppose midway during that project you feel yourself sort of 'forgetting' how important it is to you. Then it's just a simple matter of communicating with your past self who started it, have a convo about how important this thing is, and i honestly dont know who wins this conversation but if your past self wins it means they can explain to you why the thing was so important to you and you'll buy it, and be jazzed about it again</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>do any of the upcoming 11 videos have names yet? and if so, can you tell me one?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.7.25

Q: can you explain to me why 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ = -1/12 I dont quite understand?

A:
ok so here's what you can do. let's look at another series, 1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1...... repeating forever. You might say that this will equal either 1 or 0, depending on where you STOP, but of course 'forever' means you never stop. you dont stop at +1, you dont stop at -1. Let's try this...... let's try 1 minus the series. subtract the series from 1. 1-(1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1.....) subtracting something in parentheses makes all the signs flip, so that's the same thing as so when you subtract that series from one, you get the series itself. 1 minus X equals X. what could that be, do a little algebra 1-x=x 1=2x 1/2 = x Weird, but fair, i think. 1+1-1+1-1 if you EVER stop, will equal 1 or 0 depending on when you stopped, but if you truly never stop then there is no one ever to decide whether it's 1 or 0 so it's 1/2. There are other ways of showing this series (i guess we're calling it X) equals 1/2. ok back to the other series, 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8..... let's call that one A. Consider another series, 1-2+3-4+5-6+7-8 ...... forever, the signs switching back and forth forever. let's call that B. Now let's take B plus B... but for some crazy reason because you are crazy, you decide to slide it to the right a little bit when you add it. i will leave you to decide whether or not this is a legal move. Hopefully this lines up the right way on your screen, it should be slid to the right by one number, but it's still the same series B, added to itself. ========================== so here it appears that B plus B equals X, the series of alternating 1 and -1. which we found to be 1/2. So B plus B equals 1/2, which means B must equal 1/4. Now we'll take A minus B. - (1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7 - 8 - 9 ....) ============================= which is actually 4 times A (your original series) so A minus B equals (4 times A). we already saw B equals 1/4, so A minus 1/4 = 4 times A do a little algebra A - 1/4 = 4A - 1/4 = 3A - 1/12 = A There are many many other ways of getting this result. I think the key to understanding this whole thing is the fact that you "never stop". If you EVER stop, let's say you're adding 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 up to a billion and you stop, you're gonna get.... a huge number, actually it would be a billion sized triangle with a billion across the bottom. but the key is you truly actually never stop. that's where the mindfuckery probably happens. if you claim to do something literally forever then the answer is gonna kind of have to be in some kind of other dimension. and this is how we can quantify it</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Doctor I can't tell if I'm not me</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.8.25

A:
next time you can try to get a round number price. You probably won't be able to do both, unless the price of gas is a round number. in this case the price was probably 3.499 per gallon.

i pretty much didn't make it past trig in school, but it is certainly a priority for me to drastically expand my mathematical education, and i am taking steps to do so. more along the lines of whatever school i was following when i bumped into pythagoras on the toilet when i was 7. whilst contemplating toilet paper squares and their diagonals</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>If someone referred to themselves as being the least humble, is that person humble or prideful?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.10.25

A:
it's certainly handy to expose yourself to things from all different time periods. ultimately the power is going to come from you, saying what you're gonna say the way you say it, but it's always healthy to sort of 'cross pollinate' through different time periods, just in terms of what you enjoy. it will tend to increase the vibrancy of what you output, when it's time to deliver. in fact, any time someone comes along with the hot new sound, it's basically someone who is being proudly themself whilst also having been living in a slightly different musical universe from what the audience was used to in that moment</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>i really want to understand maths... what is a good way to understand trogonometry?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.11.25

A:
i don't know exactly which story i'm lifting this from, but it feels familiar: the idea that when you achieve utopia it quickly turns to hell for one reason or another. Another similar idea is that many of the most hellish scenarios are based originally on what started as a utopian idea. Highs and lows are inevitable, and even if you get everything you wished for, you'll realize you're still not ok. I'm pretty sure in an ideal situation, people are going to want a lot of games and challenges.

Q: I am unsure how I feel about jam sessions. they often seem to lack direction and gravitate around ideas that come off awkward and more often there's no development. in principle its seems already scary and somehow I feel like as a 'real musician' I ought to like them. its so different from songwriting and producing alone though. have you had similar experiences?

A:
it's a trade-off. and the same thing is true for dialogue improvisation vs scripting. Improvisation means that every moment is stamped certified genuine, impossible to feel fake. every word out of everyone's mouth, every note out of every instrument is guaranteed genuine. but as you said it can sometimes feel aimless. Writing and scripting, however, gives you a chance to really build some special things, but the sacrifice is that when you perform the thing, you're only as good as your ability to "imitate" how it felt when you first came up with the thing. so you're constantly fighting against the fake feeling of being a re-creation of a genuine moment that happened before. so it's a trade off</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Will you post more reality videos and stuff, i liked them a lot</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.12.25

Q: should good chords be so good that you notice them, or so good that you don't notice them, or some other third thing? does it depend on their placement?

A:
the main strength of chords usually happens on a very powerful subliminal level, but from time to time they will be featured in a "notice me" way. For the majority of listeners, in most cases, chords will be pulling massive emotional strings in the listener, which the listener will usually attribute to something else. they'll probably think it's entirely the lyrics making them feel like that.

yes, it settles into a logarithmic curve. not exact, but it very closely follows the curve. the number of primes up to 1000, for example, should be approximately 1000 divided by the natural log of 1000. i hope i said that right, i'm new to logs but not new to prime numbers</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>whaddaya think of panpsychism?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.12.25

A:
i wrote ts on a 3ds this almost sounds like a problem you would have if you do all your writing in the recording studio. i'm not sure if this is the case for you, but i think the way i solved that problem for myself is the advent of the separate writing session. which, in the extreme case, at first, is to take some paper someplace cozy and do all your writing on paper. imagine exactly how the song could go, from beginning to end, and write it down on paper. i dont know if this will solve the issue for you but it obliterated the issue for me</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>is it technically gay to be a straight man? since straight men like women and most women are straight which means they like men and that's gay</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.15.25

Q: I'm trying to play the bass line of the chorus of YMCA but my fingers can't seem to move that fast.

A:
for now just find another way to play it so the song still feels good. Keep in mind, as the bass player in a band playing the YMCA song, your job is not to play exactly what the original guy did on that recording session that day. Your job is to play the YMCA song, and make it feel like the party that it wants to feel like. this is your chance to be innovative, and make the song feel like this without all those extra 16th notes. you dont get any extra points for doing it the exact same way someone else did. you get party points for making the whole song altogether feel like a party, in this case. I'll give you another hint: if you are trying as hard as you can to hit those double 16th notes, and youre just barely getting it 'correct' while trying as hard as you can, guess what, it's not gonna feel good for anyone on the dance floor. but if you play a simpler version, maybe just up and down, then you'll be in a much more comfortable place to drive the party properly</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>why is it called "ueqstions"</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.16.25

there's always a new story to tell. For example, if there is an over-abundance of all the things that anyone thinks they want to hear, then suddenly it all starts to feel meaningless. so: the next story is what kind of picture can you paint, upon that backdrop, that has new meaning.

Q: why does infinity have different sizes?

A:
it's hard to really say that it has an actual 'size', but there are certainly different recipes for infinity that have different qualities. for example, you could say "how many multiples of 3 are there". then you could say "how many multiples of 4 are there" ...... well if the bounds are limitless, then there are an infinite amount of both, but considering in any given limited range there will always be more multiples of 3 than multiples of 4, it would be not quite fair to treat both infinite cases equally</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>isn't it infuriating when you can't wait to go home and write some music, only to turn on the pc and stare at the DAW software, not being able to extract anything out of your mind?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.17.25

A:
true, but you also have to be honest about whether the thing works for you. there is no shame in admitting that a certain piece of work does not move you. fake appreciation can be a waste of everyone's time, and it is a hard-written law of creativity that different things work for different people, and it can even change for the same person at different times. Although, if you are talking about a situation where an artist personally presents their work directly to you, an audience of 1, and sits there in front of you while you watch it...... that's just a terribly awkward situation that i think everyone should probably avoid 12.17.25  2:54 pm what do you think of bill wurtz? impossible to work with. probably because i demand all the credit while also being too honest to steal credit from anyone else</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Bill, when is your next song coming out?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.17.25

Q: I watched a clip from a Weird Al Yankovic interview recently in which he said that one of the reasons why he does fewer parodies these days is that there's much less of a musical monoculture than there was a few decades ago; people now are kind of mainly listening to music that fits in the specific niche subgenres they're into, and there are few new songs these days that really "everyone knows about", making it more difficult to identify what songs really are hits, compared to in the 80s, when everyone" watched MTV and knew who the biggest artists and what the biggest songs were (At least, this was my interpretation of what he said). Do you agree with this? Do you think that there's less of a centralized pop music culture than there once was, or do you think there are still songs that come out that "everyone knows about"?

A:
this is true if you only consider new releases, but if you are considering older releases then there is more common exposure to those than ever before</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>what is your favorite mountain?

i write the lyrics and music at the exact same time (they are not two different things), then record temp instruments then sing the vocal then clear the temp instruments and then do a better job on the instruments. the final product is an extremely close but more detailed representation of exactly how i already knew the song went after writing it.

Q: want a math problem i thought of? if not you can stop reading. the question is: can you play a valid game of chess where you get back to the starting position, but its BLACKs turn instead of white's in that position? if so give the moves, if not then prove it. i can come back with a hint or the answer if you want.

A:
first we can say pawns can't move because you'd never get them back. that being said, the only thing that can move is a knight, and then the rook can toggle back and forth when the knight is away. now, for the knight to return home, it must make an even number of moves, i claim. because each time the knight moves it switches to a different colored square. so for a knight to get to the same colored square it must make an even number of moves. Ok so what about the knights trading places, well for the knights to trade places, this would require an odd number of moves for each knight, still making an even number of moves in total. The only other thing to move is the rook, but this also will always be an even number of moves, because there is only one available square to toggle to. for the rook to return home it must make an even number of moves. So for everyone to return home, both sides must make an even number of moves. The problem with that: whenever it's black's turn, white has always made 1 more move han black has. which means their move totals can never be both even at the same time (unless it's white's turn). therefore this task seems to be impossible, i believe. i look forward to the humiliation of you telling me you've found a way</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Have you built a particle accelerator?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.26.25

A:
yes, you are getting at a collosally important question, which is how do we do this, what's even good, why is it good, what makes a 'good' musical experience, what makes a good story, what makes a good cinema experience, ..... what is the recipe, what is the rule, what is the formula. [spoiler ahead] what do you wish the formula was? do you enjoy being surprised by what appears to be a new formula? do you ever feel comfort in seeing a familiar formula, but with a twist sometimes? do you suppose it would be fun to sometimes even see someone use a broken formula, or the wrong formula on purpose? do you ever think it would be fun to see a formula work when it shouldn't, or not work when it should? if you answered yes to any of these questions, congratulations it's not a formula. it's you. What's the formula for 'you'? Do you think you could still know who you are without one? Would you prefer it to be easy, complex, or totally paradoxical? would you prefer being able to choose, or would you like to sometimes be surprised? if you answered yes to any of these q sorry out to lunch</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Do you think the Beatles are as good as people say they are?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.28.25

Q: I really enjoyed the Don't you want me cover with Scary Pockets. In case of such covers, I reckon all the music is prearranged beforehand by an organizing party or someone, but I wonder if and how much freedom you had. Given the level of musicians included and the free-formity of jazz-like vibes, it seems likely (to a barely musician like myself) that you guys didn't need to play the arrangement note for note and some freedoms could be allowed.

A:
How was it in the case of drums? Were some parts added by ours truly? i will tell you exactly how it went. jack was going through a real 'hurry is the only way' mentality phase at that point. he had been brutally stuck on some projects recently and was determined that the only way out was QUICK. so it was just let's get in a room and figure it out within like 20 minutes and actually even start recording it before we've even totally figured it out. but there's also another weird story about the arrangement for that song, because they had sent me the song choices the day before (which they dont normally do, i dont know why they did.) and for some reason, and maybe this is actually a generic choice, but i had the idea to do a purdie shuffle for it, but the weird thing is when ryan picked me up at the airport he said he'd also had the same idea. so me and ryan coincidentally both thought to do a purdie shuffle for it. and then the 4-on-the-floor-reggae thing in the intro i think was my idea, because i noticed that the riff actually sounded kind of like a sort of marley riff when you re-purpose it that way. And then i think to swap in some actual 16ths at the tail end of the riff was jack's idea. But the two governing principles of all the sessions at that time, for those guys, i believe, was 1: try to make it a 'different' style from the original, and 2: wing it at breakneck speed and start recording takes before you've really figured it out</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>what aren't your new years resolutions?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.3.26

Q: can you explain "The Lick"? I keep hearing about it but i don't know much about it. does it have a backstory? is it just a meme with no meaning beyond its memehood? or something else?

A:
that's been around for a long time. somewhere in the 1900s someone noticed that jazz players tend to play this one riff a lot. a friend told me about this maybe 20 years ago, sang what it was, and i was like "oh right. that one. i like that one anyway". i think the general consensus is that it's a common riff but it's actually pretty good anyway. so it's been a meme long before the word 'meme' was a meme. Then, much more recently i saw some youngsters on stage doing a show and one of them threw that in (somewhat gratuitously) and gave a memetastic glance to the bandmates, and i thought to myself "oh nice, here is some social currency that i am already familiar with. how convenient" and since then i continue to use it both by accident and on purpose</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>in "2 friends on the beach", one person asks the other if they want to go in the "lobster section". person #2 responds with "i can't handle that right now."</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.4.26

i think it's a ridiculous question for totally different reasons than you. to me what you said is also ridiculous. for me the ridiculousness about the "the meaning of life" thing is that it makes it sound like there is supposed to be 1 meaning and purpose for everyone at all times. but the way it seems to me is that there are infinite meanings all the time. new ones, old ones, it's endless. literally everything is meaningful. meaning is inescapable. even little pockets of what may seem like 'meaninglessness' only elevates the surrounding meanings</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>What do you think of this poem I wrote?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.8.26

Q: probably has been asked before but, aside from the likely technical difficulties of performing live given the range of instruments you use and the fact most of them are random electronic sounds not entirely bound to physical instruments, would you ever consider doing a live concert?

Perhaps with funky lighting that takes you on an equally epic journey as the visuals of your music videos do. Would you do it?

Do you prefer it? in some ways it always gets harder, but then it eventually becomes impossible and that always opens up a brand new door for it to become much easier. this cycle continues</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>i've been reading up on wolves recently and i think they're cool. what do you think about wolves? do you think i can be a cool wolf if i really want to. thoughts or advice?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.10.26

Q: Hi Bill !

A:
I was forced to play piano as a child but had to learn on my own, no classes or teachers. Obviously that didnt work very well and just made me resentful of music and piano in general. I could play basic chords with a bass octave on the left hand, but no sheet music, no inversions, no scales, no music theory etc. Some years back, music found its way back into my heart and i want to learn piano again. Could you give me some advice on how i could approach it? the advice i always give is you have to make it your own. although you have an interesting situation because you actually did it on your own before. this is the way i would recommend, but i think the huge difference boils down to the fact that someone else wanted you to do it. so in that case you should be all set now. whatever excites you</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>I've heard of people who give the advice, "Be yourself", but is it truly possible to be anyone other than yourself?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.11.26

If i want to be working on things of update level 1, i'll work on only things that i have come up with before but never updated, and update those things. If i'm working on update level 5, then i'll work on only things that have been updated 5 times (well actually 4 times if you dont count the original inception as an update) i should also mention it's quite often that brand new level 0s come at me out of nowhere sometimes when i wasnt even trying to write. those then get added in and become eligible alongside the other level 1s</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>the last line of one of the projects you're working on will contain the letter A.</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.11.26

Q: what does your average bass fx chain look like? any tips or warnings for people envious of your mixing?

A:
it probably will help a lot to clear the bass frequencies away from the non-bass instruments during times when the full band is playing. single out the instruments that are really doing the low frequency job (bass, kick) and let them have the low end, and keep that mostly out of the other instruments. this can help a lot. and also compressing the bass (not have a lot of loud-soft range) will help usually help. for some reason, wide loud-soft range is usually not too useful on the bass</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>I've always felt banjo is a bit of a subpar instrument.

A:
i think that's a bit of storytelling and it's certainly not the only way to look at it. another way to look at it (and also not the only way), for example, is: in the past, most animals have had to brutally fight each other for survival in many ways.

See, someone I knew recently died of something that almost killed me, and I've been having a horrendous time dealing with all of the things my brain is doing about it. I was feeling exceptionally not OK, went on YT to watch some cat videos to try to calm down, and saw one of your videos in my recommendations. I decided out of curiosity to see which of your videos were released around the time I was sick. And I found out that you posted "if the world doesn't end" right when I was... not quite well yet, but through the dark and experiencing the miracle that I had survived. It helped end a panic attack (so did the cats.) It's so strangely comforting. So I just wanted to thank you. Please keep being weird and amazing. I suppose I need a question here, so... what do you want to do if the world doesn't end?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.15.26

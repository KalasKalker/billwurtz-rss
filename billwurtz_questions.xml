Am I going insane here!?

A: yes, but, insanity is a tremendous advantage in the arts. You think a lot. you talk a lot, and you write a lot, because you think a lot. (and ultimately this is because you feel a lot). This could be, in some ways, a disadvantage because you're able to talk yourself out of just about anything.

Q: when you were struggling to write songs in the early 2010's, was it only because of perfectionism or did you not have your songwriting procedures solidified at the time.

A: for the most part after 2009 there was no more struggle. that is generally when the flood gates opened. plenty of things continued to improve and take shape after, but in general from 2009 forward it was significantly more fruitful excitement than struggle. there was also a time, many years before that, where i did plenty of writing instrumentally, but then eventually there was a sort of dark period in between where i had to figure out what i'm saying linguistically and with ideas on the more verbal side of things. but by 2009 or 10 i was fully 'out of the closet', in terms of like, ok, enough moping around not knowing what to do, ready and desperate to just fling open the door and see whatever the fuck comes out</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>why do you just make the current progress of your new videos so enigmatic. just tell me exactly where it's at. right now.</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.2.25 5:34 pm

A: normally i don't have any suggestions or critiques, but there is one thing here that seems like it's begging to be addressed. 5 times you've said 'ueqstion' which is really not right. this is the 'questions' page. what youve done is took the title design and tried to somehow write it in plain text but it doesnt work that way. it's either 'questions' or ue q stions . the q is meant to go first, but that's not so apparent when there is no color scheme to guide you</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Is it ok for gen Z to ask questions here</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.3.25 3:47 am

A: it doesnt matter how old you are, but i would disagree with the logic of grouping the age groups around what i consider arbitrary boundary lines. i think we all can relate to the uncomfortable experience of having a friend who was born 1 day before you, but they are in a different generation because they are on the last day of the previous generation and you are on the first day of the next. i mean how would they even relate to each other, it would be a forbidden friendship</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>where did all the serifs in your videos go</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.3.25 4:26 am

Q: I keep starting to learn a language, but then I get interested in another language and want to learn it instead. How can I (or should I) stick to just one?

A: sometimes what you really wanna do is alternate between pursuing new languages, then coming back to your strongest one. i think if you let yourself go wild for a little while jumping to new languages, i think quite soon you will get the urge to go back to your strongest one so you can feel better about yourself. and then eventually get restless again and want to do something new again. there might be no reason to deny this natural flow</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>why are people such idiots?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.3.25 1:16 pm

Q: how do you pick a project and stick with it? i have so many ideas but can never focus on one

And you can always use your desire for future selections as a magnetic motivator toward finishing the current selection. Now you just gotta decide on your selection method. and it really doesnt matter what it is, so you might as well make it something you can be proud of</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Do you prefer the word thingamabob or thingamajig</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.5.25 4:24 am

Q: how do you commit to a project for a long time without getting demotivated and quitting

A: the trick here is to gravitate towards projects you know mean the most to you. i don't think it's possible to change how much something means to you, but it is possible to seek out things that mean the most to you. and those projects will be the ones that will last. Then, suppose midway during that project you feel yourself sort of 'forgetting' how important it is to you. Then it's just a simple matter of communicating with your past self who started it, have a convo about how important this thing is, and i honestly dont know who wins this conversation but if your past self wins it means they can explain to you why the thing was so important to you and you'll buy it, and be jazzed about it again</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>do any of the upcoming 11 videos have names yet? and if so, can you tell me one?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.7.25 3:46 pm

Q: can you explain to me why 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ = -1/12 I dont quite understand?

A: ok so here's what you can do. let's look at another series, 1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1...... repeating forever. You might say that this will equal either 1 or 0, depending on where you STOP, but of course 'forever' means you never stop. you dont stop at +1, you dont stop at -1. Let's try this...... let's try 1 minus the series. subtract the series from 1. 1-(1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1.....) subtracting something in parentheses makes all the signs flip, so that's the same thing as 1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1..... so when you subtract that series from one, you get the series itself. 1 minus X equals X. what could that be, do a little algebra 1-x=x 1=2x 1/2 = x Weird, but fair, i think. 1+1-1+1-1 if you EVER stop, will equal 1 or 0 depending on when you stopped, but if you truly never stop then there is no one ever to decide whether it's 1 or 0 so it's 1/2. There are other ways of showing this series (i guess we're calling it X) equals 1/2. ok back to the other series, 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8..... let's call that one A. Consider another series, 1-2+3-4+5-6+7-8 ...... forever, the signs switching back and forth forever. let's call that B. Now let's take B plus B... but for some crazy reason because you are crazy, you decide to slide it to the right a little bit when you add it. i will leave you to decide whether or not this is a legal move. Hopefully this lines up the right way on your screen, it should be slid to the right by one number, but it's still the same series B, added to itself. 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7 - 8 ...... 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7 ...... ========================== 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1....... so here it appears that B plus B equals X, the series of alternating 1 and -1. which we found to be 1/2. So B plus B equals 1/2, which means B must equal 1/4. Now we'll take A minus B. 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 ..... - (1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7 - 8 - 9 ....) ============================= 4 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 20 ........ which is actually 4 times A (your original series) so A minus B equals (4 times A). we already saw B equals 1/4, so A minus 1/4 = 4 times A do a little algebra A - 1/4 = 4A - 1/4 = 3A - 1/12 = A There are many many other ways of getting this result. I think the key to understanding this whole thing is the fact that you "never stop". If you EVER stop, let's say you're adding 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 up to a billion and you stop, you're gonna get.... a huge number, actually it would be a billion sized triangle with a billion across the bottom. but the key is you truly actually never stop. that's where the mindfuckery probably happens. if you claim to do something literally forever then the answer is gonna kind of have to be in some kind of other dimension. and this is how we can quantify it</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Doctor I can't tell if I'm not me</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.8.25 5:57 am

A: the original is usually not called 'old' because there was no need to make the distinction between old and new before the new one exists, and no one wants to change their name to old something. i can promise you that almost every place in the world called 'new something' has a corresponding old place that is usually just called 'something', not 'old something'</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>just got gas at a gas station (as one does) and i managed to get exactly 12.000 gallons. but o! at what price?! $41.99! that's right, i was one cent away from a perfect $42.00, which would've been doubly exciting had it aligned with the 12.000 gallon mark. alas, i was cheated out of something special! should i be satisfied with my perfect 12.000, or upset at the price?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.8.25 7:43 pm

A: next time you can try to get a round number price. You probably won't be able to do both, unless the price of gas is a round number. in this case the price was probably 3.499 per gallon.

A: on the mac, press option slash (same button as question mark but with option instead of shift). on windows it's alt 0247. on phones it's probably in some symbol menu. but if you need it to show up in an html document such as this, you must type &amp;divide; which in fact i had to type into your question to replace the one you used, which showed up as Ã·</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>if 9 wasnt a number would you have named it 876 or 1087</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.9.25 4:52 pm

Q: You know at end of commercials on the tv or radio when they say all the "fine print" stuff really fast (like side effects for medications, etc.).. Do you think that they record the voice track at normal speed and then speed it up for that part, or do they hire voice actors that can speak very quickly?

A: heck, nowadays a lot of them probably dont even have a human for the normal speed part. but that's a separate issue. anyway, we are long past the point where that physical human talent of fast-talking is useful in this situation. In the old days, maybe 30 years ago or more, certainly a human had to really talk that fast. but the invention that changed this was the ability to speed up a recording without raising the pitch. this technology came into play sometime around the turn of the century if i'm not mistaken</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>what is your favorite trigonometric function?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.9.25 10:22 pm

A: it's certainly handy to expose yourself to things from all different time periods. ultimately the power is going to come from you, saying what you're gonna say the way you say it, but it's always healthy to sort of 'cross pollinate' through different time periods, just in terms of what you enjoy. it will tend to increase the vibrancy of what you output, when it's time to deliver. in fact, any time someone comes along with the hot new sound, it's basically someone who is being proudly themself whilst also having been living in a slightly different musical universe from what the audience was used to in that moment</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How to learn something I want to learn but don't know how?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.11.25 6:43 am

Q: read a thing which said utopia is all about longing, wanting something that can never fully be here. if that's true then is it a good idea, or even possible, to pursue utopia despite it being necessarily unattainable? or is it better to focus on the stuff we can actually do?

A: i don't know exactly which story i'm lifting this from, but it feels familiar: the idea that when you achieve utopia it quickly turns to hell for one reason or another. Another similar idea is that many of the most hellish scenarios are based originally on what started as a utopian idea. Highs and lows are inevitable, and even if you get everything you wished for, you'll realize you're still not ok. I'm pretty sure in an ideal situation, people are going to want a lot of games and challenges. There could absolutely be a futuristic way of humanity that has plenty of games and challenges in a way that is safe yet still fun</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Is your music just vibes or are you like a super serious student of music theory</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.12.25 1:28 am

Q: I am unsure how I feel about jam sessions. they often seem to lack direction and gravitate around ideas that come off awkward and more often there's no development. in principle its seems already scary and somehow I feel like as a 'real musician' I ought to like them. its so different from songwriting and producing alone though. have you had similar experiences?

A: it's a trade-off. and the same thing is true for dialogue improvisation vs scripting. Improvisation means that every moment is stamped certified genuine, impossible to feel fake. every word out of everyone's mouth, every note out of every instrument is guaranteed genuine. but as you said it can sometimes feel aimless. Writing and scripting, however, gives you a chance to really build some special things, but the sacrifice is that when you perform the thing, you're only as good as your ability to "imitate" how it felt when you first came up with the thing. so you're constantly fighting against the fake feeling of being a re-creation of a genuine moment that happened before. so it's a trade off</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Will you post more reality videos and stuff, i liked them a lot</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.12.25 4:30 am

Q: should good chords be so good that you notice them, or so good that you don't notice them, or some other third thing? does it depend on their placement?

A: the main strength of chords usually happens on a very powerful subliminal level, but from time to time they will be featured in a "notice me" way. For the majority of listeners, in most cases, chords will be pulling massive emotional strings in the listener, which the listener will usually attribute to something else. they'll probably think it's entirely the lyrics making them feel like that.

Q: what's resolve mean in music

A: you can pretty much use that word however you want. you have to hear the music yourself, and then if you feel like that would be a good word to describe anything youre hearing, go for it, otherwise you dont need the word. If someone else describes a part of the music and uses that word, then just ask them which part they're talking about. and if you agree with them that it feels that way, then you can be like 'oh yeah true' and if you totally dont agree that it feels that way then you could give them maybe a bit of side eye</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>What to do if I want to write music but can't stop thinking about math</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.13.25 10:26 pm

A: certain phrases can act like a time capsule, preserving the individual words in them from another time, when they wouldnt be used individually. there are hundreds of examples of this. "lo and behold" is still recognizable, but the word "lo" on its own is probably completely gone.

A: this almost sounds like a problem you would have if you do all your writing in the recording studio. i'm not sure if this is the case for you, but i think the way i solved that problem for myself is the advent of the separate writing session. which, in the extreme case, at first, is to take some paper someplace cozy and do all your writing on paper. imagine exactly how the song could go, from beginning to end, and write it down on paper. i dont know if this will solve the issue for you but it obliterated the issue for me</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>What sort of music do you like to listen to, if at all?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.15.25 4:40 pm

Q: I'm trying to play the bass line of the chorus of YMCA but my fingers can't seem to move that fast.

A: for now just find another way to play it so the song still feels good. Keep in mind, as the bass player in a band playing the YMCA song, your job is not to play exactly what the original guy did on that recording session that day. Your job is to play the YMCA song, and make it feel like the party that it wants to feel like. this is your chance to be innovative, and make the song feel like this without all those extra 16th notes. you dont get any extra points for doing it the exact same way someone else did. you get party points for making the whole song altogether feel like a party, in this case. I'll give you another hint: if you are trying as hard as you can to hit those double 16th notes, and youre just barely getting it 'correct' while trying as hard as you can, guess what, it's not gonna feel good for anyone on the dance floor. but if you play a simpler version, maybe just up and down, then you'll be in a much more comfortable place to drive the party properly</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>why is it called "ueqstions"</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.16.25 9:31 am

A: true, but you also have to be honest about whether the thing works for you. there is no shame in admitting that a certain piece of work does not move you. fake appreciation can be a waste of everyone's time, and it is a hard-written law of creativity that different things work for different people, and it can even change for the same person at different times. Although, if you are talking about a situation where an artist personally presents their work directly to you, an audience of 1, and sits there in front of you while you watch it...... that's just a terribly awkward situation that i think everyone should probably avoid</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Bill, when is your next song coming out?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.17.25 4:21 pm

I'm pretty shy in general, so unsurprisingly it took me forever to even get comfortable talking to her. it is here that she asks me about my crushes on campus, and after I fumble before asking her back, she tells me about her own crush that rejected her. at this point I consciously force myself to draw the conclusion that it's over. an incredibly common story now that I think about it, but for reasons I still don't understand, I decided to compose a roughly 4 minute piano piece. forever x3 later when said brain's finally gaining back some semblance of normalcy, I once again inexplicably composed.

Q: so there's been a somewhat recent sequence of events in my life that I'm not sure what to make of. it starts with the bog-standard situation of my brain deciding to develop a crush on someone. I'm pretty shy in general, so unsurprisingly it took me forever to even get comfortable talking to her. it is here that she asks me about my crushes on campus, and after I fumble before asking her back, she tells me about her own crush that rejected her. at this point I consciously force myself to draw the conclusion that it's over. an incredibly common story now that I think about it, but for reasons I still don't understand, I decided to compose a roughly 4 minute piano piece. forever x3 later when said brain's finally gaining back some semblance of normalcy, I once again inexplicably composed. I'm not sure if the specifics are relevant to the question of "why?" why would I mull over sadness, let alone give it form? and why am I proud of them even though their inspiration still invokes sadness? I came across this thing once, that essentially there's infinite everythings. infinite songs, infinite memories, infinite outcomes, infinite nostalgias. it's scary. why do Ihave to choose? I may have only created them as a way of dealing with whatI felt, but why get attached to any of them if there's always infinite more?

Q: want a math problem i thought of? if not you can stop reading. the question is: can you play a valid game of chess where you get back to the starting position, but its BLACKs turn instead of white's in that position? if so give the moves, if not then prove it. i can come back with a hint or the answer if you want.

A: first we can say pawns can't move because you'd never get them back. that being said, the only thing that can move is a knight, and then the rook can toggle back and forth when the knight is away. now, for the knight to return home, it must make an even number of moves, i claim. because each time the knight moves it switches to a different colored square. so for a knight to get to the same colored square it must make an even number of moves. Ok so what about the knights trading places, well for the knights to trade places, this would require an odd number of moves for each knight, still making an even number of moves in total. The only other thing to move is the rook, but this also will always be an even number of moves, because there is only one available square to toggle to. for the rook to return home it must make an even number of moves. So for everyone to return home, both sides must make an even number of moves. The problem with that: whenever it's black's turn, white has always made 1 more move han black has. which means their move totals can never be both even at the same time (unless it's white's turn). therefore this task seems to be impossible, i believe. i look forward to the humiliation of you telling me you've found a way</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Have you built a particle accelerator?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.26.25 11:21 am

A: yes, you are getting at a collosally important question, which is how do we do this, what's even good, why is it good, what makes a 'good' musical experience, what makes a good story, what makes a good cinema experience, ..... what is the recipe, what is the rule, what is the formula. [spoiler ahead] what do you wish the formula was? do you enjoy being surprised by what appears to be a new formula? do you ever feel comfort in seeing a familiar formula, but with a twist sometimes? do you suppose it would be fun to sometimes even see someone use a broken formula, or the wrong formula on purpose? do you ever think it would be fun to see a formula work when it shouldn't, or not work when it should? if you answered yes to any of these questions, congratulations it's not a formula. it's you. What's the formula for 'you'? Do you think you could still know who you are without one? Would you prefer it to be easy, complex, or totally paradoxical? would you prefer being able to choose, or would you like to sometimes be surprised? if you answered yes to any of these q sorry out to lunch</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Do you think the Beatles are as good as people say they are?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>12.28.25 1:24 pm

Q: I really enjoyed the Don't you want me cover with Scary Pockets. In case of such covers, I reckon all the music is prearranged beforehand by an organizing party or someone, but I wonder if and how much freedom you had.

How was it in the case of drums? Were some parts added by ours truly?

A: i will tell you exactly how it went. jack was going through a real 'hurry is the only way' mentality phase at that point. he had been brutally stuck on some projects recently and was determined that the only way out was QUICK. so it was just let's get in a room and figure it out within like 20 minutes and actually even start recording it before we've even totally figured it out. but there's also another weird story about the arrangement for that song, because they had sent me the song choices the day before (which they dont normally do, i dont know why they did.) and for some reason, and maybe this is actually a generic choice, but i had the idea to do a purdie shuffle for it, but the weird thing is when ryan picked me up at the airport he said he'd also had the same idea. so me and ryan coincidentally both thought to do a purdie shuffle for it. and then the 4-on-the-floor-reggae thing in the intro i think was my idea, because i noticed that the riff actually sounded kind of like a sort of marley riff when you re-purpose it that way. And then i think to swap in some actual 16ths at the tail end of the riff was jack's idea. But the two governing principles of all the sessions at that time, for those guys, i believe, was 1: try to make it a 'different' style from the original, and 2: wing it at breakneck speed and start recording takes before you've really figured it out</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>what aren't your new years resolutions?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.3.26 7:11 am

Q: can you explain "The Lick"? I keep hearing about it but i don't know much about it. does it have a backstory? is it just a meme with no meaning beyond its memehood? or something else?

A: that's been around for a long time. somewhere in the 1900s someone noticed that jazz players tend to play this one riff a lot. a friend told me about this maybe 20 years ago, sang what it was, and i was like "oh right. that one. i like that one anyway". i think the general consensus is that it's a common riff but it's actually pretty good anyway. so it's been a meme long before the word 'meme' was a meme. Then, much more recently i saw some youngsters on stage doing a show and one of them threw that in (somewhat gratuitously) and gave a memetastic glance to the bandmates, and i thought to myself "oh nice, here is some social currency that i am already familiar with. how convenient" and since then i continue to use it both by accident and on purpose</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>in "2 friends on the beach", one person asks the other if they want to go in the "lobster section". person #2 responds with "i can't handle that right now." now, this begs the question, what IS in the lobster section?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.4.26 10:22 pm

Q: in "2 friends on the beach", one person asks the other if they want to go in the "lobster section". person #2 responds with "i can't handle that right now." now, this begs the question, what IS in the lobster section?

A: it does in fact beg that question, and, whether you've noticed or not, from this section or elsewhere, i am in fact the kind of guy who begs for questions.

Could you give me some advice on how i could approach it?

A: the advice i always give is you have to make it your own. although you have an interesting situation because you actually did it on your own before. this is the way i would recommend, but i think the huge difference boils down to the fact that someone else wanted you to do it. so in that case you should be all set now. whatever excites you</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>I've heard of people who give the advice, "Be yourself", but is it truly possible to be anyone other than yourself?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.11.26 4:48 am

Q: hey! I'm in the process of reinventing the way I write music and I'm curious where you start your writing process. What do you typically start with when writing music?

A: i start with what level of update i want to be working on. For example: if i'm working on update level zero, i'll come up with some brand new things. If i want to be working on things of update level 1, i'll work on only things that i have come up with before but never updated, and update those things. If i'm working on update level 5, then i'll work on only things that have been updated 5 times (well actually 4 times if you dont count the original inception as an update) i should also mention it's quite often that brand new level 0s come at me out of nowhere sometimes when i wasnt even trying to write. those then get added in and become eligible alongside the other level 1s</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>the last line of one of the projects you're working on will contain the letter A.</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.11.26 5:26 pm

A: the word 'doubt' probably is more like youre leaning toward 'no' about something. but the word 'uncertainty' is probably less specific. it probably just means you dont know.

Q: Does our free will to make choices actually create alternate timelines or are we just too busy living in our crazy world to realize we're too predictable to make any other choice?

A: i am certainly a believer in the 'many worlds' theory, of infinitely branching timelines at any given moment, and free will is essentially us choosing which one to go on right now. while i also believe that we will probably do all the others EVENTUALLY as it comes back around in infinite million lifetimes. also i think this necessitates the belief that each one will also be chosen infinite times</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>i love your music, would you ever consider making a full length album?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.13.26 9:45 pm

A: "connaisseur" is from french, meaning expert/judge/taster. "aficionado" is from spanish, it means a fan/enthusiast of something but it also means 'amateur'. The meanings of those 2 words may have merged together a little when used in english, but looking into french and spanish i can see that perhaps the connaisseur may perhaps be a little more high brow than the aficionado</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>any tips on how to reconcile with something you have to live with forever?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.14.26 3:07 am

Q: what does your average bass fx chain look like? any tips or warnings for people envious of your mixing?

A: it probably will help a lot to clear the bass frequencies away from the non-bass instruments during times when the full band is playing. single out the instruments that are really doing the low frequency job (bass, kick) and let them have the low end, and keep that mostly out of the other instruments. this can help a lot. and also compressing the bass (not have a lot of loud-soft range) will help usually help. for some reason, wide loud-soft range is usually not too useful on the bass</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>have you ever thought of making a full length album?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.14.26 6:29 am

A: i think that's a bit of storytelling and it's certainly not the only way to look at it. another way to look at it (and also not the only way), for example, is: in the past, most animals have had to brutally fight each other for survival in many ways. Nowadays, we humans still find ourselves having to do that to some degree but we are deeply devoted to keeping this at an absolute minimum, we almost unilaterally consider it 'bad', and we are becoming increasingly more ashamed about it</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>what do i say at the interview to make them want to hire me</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.14.26 10:15 am

A: i suppose it COULD be reduced to a long series of binary decisions. for example, even if there's 10 things, you can still narrow it down to 1 just by dividing it into 2 groups a series of times, choosing one of them each time. then you might even make a different choice tomorrow</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>why must we feel pain</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.20.26 2:41 pm

Q: Is there some significance to the phrase "i was going to say no but now that i think about it yes"?

A: it's one of the 3 basic answers. "yes", "no", and "i was going to say no but now that i think about it yes". Actually, now that i think about it, there logistically should be a 4th one: "i was going to say yes but now that i think about it no". But for some reason the "no--&gt;yes" version seems to be used at least 10x more often than "yes--&gt;no". i wonder what that says about the underlying yesness of questions</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Do you find yourself naturally driven to experiment and create in the way that you seem to do in your videos?

A: at this point, what comes to mind is: Sometimes as an audience member we may see something and think to ourselves "eh, that was probably faked. or at least if it wasnt, it could have been. or even SHOULD have been, to save time." Regardless of whether the thing was faked or not, this still creates a lousy detached feeling for the audience, just to have been brought to this thought process. So the goal is to find ways to never give the audience that feeling. this might be one of the most exciting creative challenges there ever was, but at the same time it's also an echo of similar challenges at earlier stages in our technological history</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>If a self driving car has a computer to drive it, is the car driving itself or the computer driving the car?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.21.26 1:50 pm

A: My process is seemingly so different from yours (as I understand it).

To me that seems CRAZY as so much of the writing process TO ME is feeling out what chord best fits next to hit emotionally where I feel the song going, a process that I feel I could never capture abstractly to ever "mathematically" whoa whoa whoa hold on. Are you able to sit in a quiet room and write down english sentences that you'd want to say, and is there anything 'mathematical' about that? deduce what chord I'm looking for, you know?

How do you know what chords, inversions, voicings, qualities, etc are going to hit how you expect them to when you go to record a song you have written? the same way you know what words to use, which, as i always say, is quite a miracle. the imagination is mysterious and powerful (Of course this is all built on the assumption that I understand your writing process being done on paper first, and assuming you have all the chords written out, and a melody in mind, before actually playing any notes... please correct me if Iam wrong.)

Q: i've been making instrumentals actively for about half a year now, and i want to move into songwriting. but that involves writing lyrics, and whenever i try doing that, i always think "this is too cheesy" and scrap it. did you ever experience this, and how did you get through it (at least partially)

A: the problem is you havent figured out how to put your deepest feelings into words. heck, you may not have even allowed your deepest feelings to learn how to speak. in fact i know you havent. (you'd know if you have, it feels pretty psycho). So at this juncture the only thing youve been able to do is to just kind of.... write what maybe most other people would have... written? which of course is cheesy and not even real. so basically you need to do the crazy thing of, little by little, actually teaching your deepest darkest demons to talk. which feels psycho and is pretty psycho, for sure. allow approximately the same amount of time as it took your superficial self to learn how to talk</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Is it ever useful to harp on the past?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.22.26 9:25 pm

Q: What do you think about songs which repeat the same lyric without ever expanding on the idea of that lyric? Also, what do you think about songs which repeat the same chords or rhythms throughout the entire song without changing them up? Does it feel like the musician is trying to pad out the runtime of their song by minimizing the effort spent composing the song and writing the lyrics, or is there a good reason to keep repeating some parts of a song without variation? Why does it feel like modern songs are just composed of simple loops and lyrics, rather than feeling like every part of the song is unique?

A: there's a lot to unpack here. first, the golden rule. what one listener might find 'useless and repetitive', another listener might find totally enthralling. and, for a different song, those same two listeners' opinions might even be reversed. totally separate question, do music artists sometimes try to fill out the runtime of songs just because they think it 'should' fill up that much time; probably yes some people do that and i'd be of course wholeheartedly against that and i lecture against it frequently. part of a general anti-should worldview that i probably have, when it comes to creativity. ("should i do this, should i do that, whats the 'correct' way", art suffocates when asked these questions. either it's driving you wild or it's not.) then thirdly you indicated that you are feeling that songmakers currently seem to be generally not living up to your expectations of them. It is perfectly natural and normal to feel this way. And what i always strongly advocate is: use this frustration to fuel your inspiration to do it better. If you truly believe you are onto something that 'most other songmakers' are not, ..... then, ... my goodness what a huge gift that is. this is exactly the kind of scenario that can inspire a whole career</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>what gets you out of the bed in the morning</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.23.26 5:25 am

I made a bit of music i liked, and as i was listening to it i looked in the mirror and saw someone with burgeoning forehead wrinkles and a receding hairline looking back at me, and suddenly i felt like i dont deserve to make art and that it only belongs to people that still have their youth. if i may tell you the opposite side of the story, people who are young and attractive sometimes find themselves in a peculiar situation where they find they have to work twice as hard to convince people they actually have real talent. sometimes they feel they need to overcome the perception that their success is based on looks alone it felt like i needed to give up on art and just get a boring job and try and start a family or whatever. i understand this is stupid and based on societal expectations and recognizing patterns of young attractive people making music and old people working normal jobs. but. its really affecting my ability to conceptualize myself making art in the future. I keep imagining myself at like 47 strumming the same stupid guitar and playing the same chords and i feel so infantile. if youre bored with strumming that particular guitar then that has nothing to do with age. if youre having these thoughts then it almost seems like you might be bored with it now already i really respect how committed you are to making art for as long as you can be alive, and i feel the same way, it just feels so stupid to have a hang up like this interfere with what i'd ostensibly thought was my life's mission. maybe if im weak enough to let something like aging bother me this much then i wasn't cut out for making art. i dont know. maybe you've felt something similar? sorry about this stupid rambling non-question vent session. also im 23 years old yeah yeah yeah cue laugh track i know i know im young. i just feel old as balls there are so many different ways to go about all these life issues, i dont even think i could list them all. but it seems pretty standard that the biggest and brightest stars of creativity have certainly suffered at least the same insecurities as you've felt. but it seems like this sets up a nice pit of misery to rebel against. which is exactly what your work needs to make it come alive</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>What would you do for a Klondike bar?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.23.26 8:35 pm

Q: Are you still able to enjoy simple music even though you write pretty complex jazzy stuff? Do you ever listen to Believe by Cher because of how incredible it is, despite being a pretty basic song?

A: there's a lot to unpack here. you assumed 2 things about the song you mention, as if they are facts "it's incredible" and "it's basic". both those things could be true for some people at some times, but they dont have to be. but then the main question you raise, i think, has to do with complex vs simple and is one or the other better to me, and my answer is no absolutely not. complex and simple are both wonderful. stereotypically i feel there is a prevalent viewpoint out there that complexity ruins music, but then again there's another prevalant viewpoint out there that complains about 'mindless/stupid' music. i basically reject both viewpoints, and i maintain that there is not even any definition of what makes music good, AND, most of the time there's not even any eact definition of what makes something complex or simple. but to get perhaps closer to what you were asking, i do like the song, i dont really think it's basic, but i also do not consider 'basic' an inherently positive OR negative trait, nor is it even definable</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>should i persist</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.25.26 6:51 am

A: i think the name of the format ('standup comedy') is inherently embarrassing; but it's a perfectly great format. perhaps 'public speaking' would be a much much more appropriate name for this format. the strange thing is, calling it that would probably make it much much more funny. the formal expectation that something is required to be funny is just about the worst curse you can put on the funnyness of anything</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>What's your favorite species of tree</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.25.26 10:15 am

You also commonly say your songs are based on how it felt to write them. how did everything become pink during the songwriting (whether literally or metaphorically)? Also big fan of your vids, bill

A: i'll tell you exactly what that is. it's a song ending. it's a very strange thing for a song to end. when you're in the song, the song is the whole world. but eventually the song has to end and you have to transition into the world outside of that song. so song endings, at least for me, often have this weird shocking quality to them, kind of like a vestubule of a building, or a decompression chamber. or that space between the inner and outer wrapper, on a loaf of bread. nevermind, better metaphor, it's like the song is dying. the song ends, so the ending of songs often sounds like the song is being killed. that way a plausible next move for the song at that point would be to no longer be playing</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Does Dasani Water count as water?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.29.26 4:12 am

Q: do you remember the way some songs were written when they become relevant to a specific moment in your life? eg. "just did a bad thing", and coping with the fact that you just did a bad thing by remembering your written wisdom on the subject of doing a bad thing

A: actually what happened on that one was i had narrowed it down to about 20 choices for which song (or song idea) was going to be the next one to finish and record, and that was one of them. it was certainly not my favorite, but it must not have been my least favorite because it made the top 20. that idea itself is not related to any particular bad thing or other, it's just a song idea which i apparently thought was cool when i came up with it. and slightly cool when i picked it for the top 20. Then i started narrowing it down by eliminating ones from the 20, that was probably one of the first to get eliminated, then i kept eliminating them and eventually i got it down to 1, but i didnt really want to do that one either, so i eliminated that one as well. I just sort of frustratedly shrugged and said "well that wasn't the point", and i un-eliminated all of them and then just quickly chose the "bad thing" one, because it was kind of the one that felt the weakest. because the point is that it shouldn't matter which song you choose, any idea can be made good. And the truth is, it can actually be very energizing to work with a weaker idea, because it makes the creative engine turn on stronger, to compensate. and that's certainly what i noticed, after getting started on it and writing the next 8 bars or so. so sometimes i refer to the "bad thing" as the fact that i accidentally eliminated all of my choices and ended up going with the weakest one. Other times, i tell the story that the "bad thing" was that i spent simultaneously too much and too little time on the production of the song, and accidentally spent the exact right amount of time, but that's another story</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>how do i not tie my self worth to my work, and similarly, how do I not take judgement of work as an attack on myself?

Q: now that you mention it, i actually think purple and yellow is not a bad color scheme. it's pretty. it also reminds me of someone i loved in the past, who had these two as their favourite colors. what do purple and yellow mean to you?

A: at some point at a young age i think i saw something that was yellow and purple, and i remember thinking "huh.... i dont think i've ever seen that before. .... cool." and then a few years later i saw something else that was yellow and purple, and i remember thinking "oh, hey, there's those 2 colors that i saw years ago and thought was cool... huh... cool." so for some reason i've always had a special feeling about those 2 colors together. so when i built this page it was like "ok, the time has come"</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>do you think its worth being honest (i misspelled honest as homest earlier to be honest)</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.30.26 7:18 am

A: the real power of art comes from something unseen, mysterious, and unpredictable. "effort and skill" are usually part of our attempts to wrangle it. and honestly it does not like to be wrangled. i'd say "skill" might come in handy sometimes, but "effort" can be a real parade rainer. the hard part is restraining this when you care so much</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>do you like roleplaying?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.30.26 11:40 am

A: in most cases, any song is secretly about itself. i believe this of almost all songs by any artist. actually to be more specific, a song is about life, but then the song hopefully is also aware of how it's doing so far, and is able to react accordingly as it goes along</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>should the seagulls leave the fishies alone</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.30.26 7:32 pm

A: i dont think i see anything wrong here, you're just finding out how sensitive and intense this game is. your feelings of envy also indicate to me, i think, that you know you're meant to be involved in it somehow. and then also, it's important to remember that this hypnotic superpower you've seen on display is not something that's held under a lock and key somewhere. it flows through all of us, in different ways all the time. actually, what you experienced from that time you saw that thing, that probably says more about you than it does about them. it's at least a 50/50 collaborative moment you had between you and the artist. Perhaps just the other day, that artist maybe saw something by another artist that made them melt with envy. maybe something that would not have moved you in the same way. but then let's say that other artist (the second artist, you being the third, for those keeping score) maybe sees a piece of your work, something youve done, and maybe THAT moves them to tears and sends them into a jealous rage. it all comes full circle, but the knock out 'wow' factor is something that visits us all, it just doesnt like to be told exactly when and where</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>how do i come up witha psuedonym</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>2.2.26 12:19 am

Q: are diminished 7 chords even real

A: i think what can happen is, the naming system taught in your textbooks will naturally lead you to a bias that certain namable chords within that system are more common than the ones which dont have names, which is not quite true. BUT, they still very much exist in actual music. at least that one does. (hint: in the key of C, the ones youre most likely to see are the ones like C#dim7, F#dim7, or G#min7. and the next chord will probably be a halfstep higher, such as Dmin7, C/G (C over G bass), or Amin)</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>My job requires me to have creative output during regular 8 hour shifts.

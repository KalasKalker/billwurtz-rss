Would it be reasonable to call the equals sign ("=") the equator? it would be great except in english that word already has a strong universal connotation with the 0 degree latitude line on the earth globe. like even if you were not already talking about globes, youre doing math doing math etc then you say 'equator' and immediately everyone now thinks youre talking about globes. the word is already in use for that.

hi bill, i have a physics issue I came up with that i want your opinion on: imagine a perfect sphere one meter in diameter, made of a nondescript matter with perfect curvature and no substructures (atoms, quarks, molecules, etc). A perfect sphere, as if someone just drag-and-dropped a UV sphere from blender into the real world. What do you think would happen when our real atoms touched this theoretical object? would our atoms be pushed into each-other, undergoing fusion, or something more interesting? according to the description it seems to be monkeying with things on a subatomic level, which, at the very least, means i have no idea what would happen, or if the thing would even be visible, or what. but something tells me there is also something not well enough defined about the question. but i assure you i do not know, i am not a physicist</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:17:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>5:34 pm</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.12.26

Does our free will to make choices actually create alternate timelines or are we just too busy living in our crazy world to realize we're too predictable to make any other choice? i am certainly a believer in the 'many worlds' theory, of infinitely branching timelines at any given moment, and free will is essentially us choosing which one to go on right now. while i also believe that we will probably do all the others EVENTUALLY as it comes back around in infinite million lifetimes. also i think this necessitates the belief that each one will also be chosen infinite times</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:17:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>9:45 pm</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.13.26

Keep up the great work, you are needed. i've generally found it boring and a little unsettling to talk about physical body processes to a wide audience, HOWEVER, going into the AI era this is changing a little because i think being a real-blooded human-ass being is starting to become a more cherished thing to be proud of. like, i actually use toilets, if you can believe that shit</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:17:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>12:36 am</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.14.26

What's the difference between a connoisseur and an aficionado? "connaisseur" is from french, meaning expert/judge/taster. "aficionado" is from spanish, it means a fan/enthusiast of something but it also means 'amateur'.

what does your average bass fx chain look like? any tips or warnings for people envious of your mixing? it probably will help a lot to clear the bass frequencies away from the non-bass instruments during times when the full band is playing. single out the instruments that are really doing the low frequency job (bass, kick) and let them have the low end, and keep that mostly out of the other instruments. this can help a lot. and also compressing the bass (not have a lot of loud-soft range) will help usually help. for some reason, wide loud-soft range is usually not too useful on the bass</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:17:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>have you ever thought of making a full length album?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.14.26  6:29 am

I've always felt banjo is a bit of a subpar instrument. I mean, it produces a unique kind of sound so this fact alone justifies its existence, but to me it always lacked some richness and sexiness that comes from other stringed instruments like guitar. (Side note I just realized - banjo is kinda like a reverse bass. Or maybe ukulele is) I know it has its use cases and wouldn't want to tell anyone what to play bc who the heck am What are you thoughts on banjo? i've used it in probably the majority of my songs. it's incredibly groovy. so in this case i apologize, if you have ever listened to my music, for all the banjo in it</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:17:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>8:10 am</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.14.26

have you heard of the new instinct-vs-intellect explanation of the human condition and do you think it's probable? basically that our ape ancestors were completely instinctively orientated to love, but that when they developed a conscious mind it clashed with the instincts, causing it to become psychologically upset which is the mad state we still suffer from today and have for eons tried to free ourselves from i think that's a bit of storytelling and it's certainly not the only way to look at it. another way to look at it (and also not the only way), for example, is: in the past, most animals have had to brutally fight each other for survival in many ways.

how do i actually make music? i like making fun sound on the piano but i look into making music and its just piles of words i dont understand.. so how do you go from "oh this sounds nice" to a completed song? at some point it's worth asking yourself what you feel a completed song should be. Do you feel other songmakers have gotten it right, or deep down do you wish it was a little different?</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:17:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>8:50 pm</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.14.26

Hello, I just wanted to thank you for something. See, someone I knew recently died of something that almost killed me, and I've been having a horrendous time dealing with all of the things my brain is doing about it. I was feeling exceptionally not OK, went on YT to watch some cat videos to try to calm down, and saw one of your videos in my recommendations. I decided out of curiosity to see which of your videos were released around the time I was sick. And I found out that you posted "if the world doesn't end" right when I was... not quite well yet, but through the dark and experiencing the miracle that I had survived. It helped end a panic attack (so did the cats.) It's so strangely comforting. So I just wanted to thank you. Please keep being weird and amazing. I suppose I need a question here, so... what do you want to do if the world doesn't end? make a huge pile of songs that is twice as high and twice as important as all the others before</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:17:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>5:24 pm</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>1.15.26

A: i dont think i see anything wrong here, you're just finding out how sensitive and intense this game is. your feelings of envy also indicate to me, i think, that you know you're meant to be involved in it somehow. and then also, it's important to remember that this hypnotic superpower you've seen on display is not something that's held under a lock and key somewhere. it flows through all of us, in different ways all the time. actually, what you experienced from that time you saw that thing, that probably says more about you than it does about them. it's at least a 50/50 collaborative moment you had between you and the artist. Perhaps just the other day, that artist maybe saw something by another artist that made them melt with envy. maybe something that would not have moved you in the same way. but then let's say that other artist (the second artist, you being the third, for those keeping score) maybe sees a piece of your work, something youve done, and maybe THAT moves them to tears and sends them into a jealous rage. it all comes full circle, but the knock out 'wow' factor is something that visits us all, it just doesnt like to be told exactly when and where</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 06:58:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>how do i come up witha psuedonym</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>2.2.26 12:19 am

Q: are diminished 7 chords even real

A: i think what can happen is, the naming system taught in your textbooks will naturally lead you to a bias that certain namable chords within that system are more common than the ones which dont have names, which is not quite true. BUT, they still very much exist in actual music. at least that one does. (hint: in the key of C, the ones youre most likely to see are the ones like C#dim7, F#dim7, or G#min7. and the next chord will probably be a halfstep higher, such as Dmin7, C/G (C over G bass), or Amin)</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 06:58:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>My job requires me to have creative output during regular 8 hour shifts.

Q: i find myself getting bored with most music (stuff outside of my comfort zone), which is a bummer because most music has a lot to offer. should i try to enjoy most music with a different perspective or just keep listening to the few things i really like?

A: there's something that i think a lot of people dont realize about music....... to fully activate the music experience it needs to be anchored for you somehow. There are plenty of ways this can happen, and it's already happened to you for the music you already like, and you may not even recall what the anchor was for you, but the issue is that there is music out there that has not been anchored for you and youre having trouble finding an in-road. so how do things get anchored? for example: movies can do it. when a song is placed well in a movie, it lifts the movie and it lifts the song to heavenly heights, probably heigher than each could have reached individually. so that's a common way for songs to get their anchor, and then you'll love the song forever after that. Another possible way is if you simply hear it out in public, such as in a retail store or playing out of someone's car. songs can be anchored that way. and as long as you catch what song it was you can add songs to your collection that way, which will always have special meaning to you from the memory of when you heard it that one time</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 06:58:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>i'm gonna tear my own hair out about what makes an idea worthwhile and what amount of effort satisfies me</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>2.5.26 8:18 pm

Q: genuine question, how do you typically write music (as in lyrics)? you're writing style is very unique and i genuinely want to know how you are able to articulate an idea into the way you write.

A: you say "music (as in lyrics)", this would be the first hazard..... to think of the lyrics separately from the music or melody. Equally problematic is to let the melody writing get too far ahead of the lyrics. The most genuine and healthy songwriting occurs when the words and melody are already attached to each other from the moment of inception. because, often, they rely on each other to justify each other's existence. they justify each other's every turn. that being said, how do these things come to mind? it's like waiting for santa claus except imagine if you had no idea what day or time he was going to show up. also imagine the one thing santa claus hates is to show up exactly when you thought he was supposed to. as a songwriter, the only time things actually work is when you are totally helpless, then it suddenly becomes effortless</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 06:58:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>opinion on the fact of opinions may be facts that are opinions on facts?</title><link>https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html</link><description>2.7.26 8:35 pm
